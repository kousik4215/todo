The financial landscape is increasingly complex, and individuals and businesses seek expert guidance to navigate investment options, manage funds, and plan for their financial future. This project focuses on the development of an interactive financial service consultancy platform using the Angular framework. Angular, a robust front-end technology, offers a structured and dynamic approach to building engaging web applications.

The proposed financial service consultancy platform aims to connect clients with expert financial advisors and services to help them make informed decisions about their finances. The platform will provide personalized advice, portfolio management tools, educational resources, and communication channels to facilitate effective financial planning and decision-making.
Development of a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application using the MEAN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js) to showcase the capabilities of this technology stack in building efficient and interactive web applications.
The financial service consultancy platform developed using Angular will showcase the capabilities of the framework in creating a secure and user-centric platform for financial guidance and planning. And also, the project demonstrates the creation of a CRUD application that covers all essential operations on data: creating new records, reading existing records, updating records, and deleting records. The MEAN Stack offers an ideal platform for this purpose, combining a NoSQL database, a server-side framework, a front-end framework, and a runtime environment.
